Simple Digital Wallet System:

This project involves creating a simplified version of a digital wallet system. The
primary goal is to enable users to perform basic financial transactions and manage
their balance within a secure environment. Each user will have an account that can
hold a balance, send money to other users, and receive money. Transactions should
be secure and require user authentication.
The System ............
> Users should be able to:
1. Register and create an account with a unique username and secure
password.
2. Log in to their account.
3. View their current balance.
4. Send money to other users by specifying the recipient's username and the
amount.
5. Request money from other users by specifying the sender's username and
the amount.
6. View a history of transactions (sent and received).
7. Edit user profiles (e.g., change password).
8. Log out of the application.
The system should ensure that a user cannot send more money than they have in
their balance. All transactions should be reflected immediately in the users'
balances.
> In addition to the user functionalities, the system will include an admin role with
enhanced privileges for managing the platform. The admin will have access to the
following functionalities:
1. Secure login for the admin using a username and password.
2. Ability to view a list of all registered users, including their usernames,
current balances, and transaction history.
3. Admin can add, edit, delete, or suspend user accounts. Suspended accounts
cannot perform any transactions until reactivated.
4. View all transactions within the system, including sender, recipient, amount,
and date/time of the transaction.
5. The admin has the ability to adjust a user's balance.
